Sample app to show off BaseTest and BaseViewTest using telerik components. In the xunit project, see XUnitInfra directory which is the current implementation on how to instantiate most visual tests. See ViewModelTests.cs and LabelTests.cs to show off successful uses of the base test to test maui visual components. See TelerikComponentTests.cs to see the common use case test.

In the test explorer window, note that 33 telerik tests pass and 25 fail.
The goal is to get all of them to pass with your help. If they are able to be instantiated, we can work from there to unit test our own bussiness logic.
